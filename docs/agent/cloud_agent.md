A cloud agent is a server that exposes the agent OpenAPI. You can access the agent over REST using an API key.

### Deploy a cloud agent

You can create your own cloud agent set or you can use the cli and a .yml configuration like we have in our [Heroku Cloud Agent](https://github.com/uport-project/daf-deploy-heroku).

A cloud agent could be for an individual, an organisation or a service. Depending on what you are building you could have multiple cloud agents running in your infrastructure.

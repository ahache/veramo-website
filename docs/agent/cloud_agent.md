A cloud agent is an agent that is running in your own cloud environment that you can access remotely over `REST` or `GraphQL`.

To deploy your own cloud agent you can follow our tutorial here. A cloud agent could be for an individual, an organisation or a service. Customising the cloud agent with your own plugins in very easy using a configuration file and the server included in the CLI. We also a have a cloud configuration wizard to help you.

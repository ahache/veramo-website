## MetaData interface

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

Represents message metadata as it is stored by [DataStore](./data-store.datastore.md).

This metadata is most often used by [MessageHandler](./message-handler.messagehandler.md) and [IMessageHandler](./core-types.imessagehandler.md) implementations to decorate messages that are interpreted and decoded, but not returned as final, as they pass through the message handler chain.

- This API may change without a BREAKING CHANGE notice.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface MetaData
```

Used for the discovery of information about the current status of a verifiable credential, such as whether it is suspended or revoked. The precise contents of the credential status information is determined by the specific `credentialStatus` type definition, and varies depending on factors such as whether it is simple to implement or if it is privacy-enhancing.

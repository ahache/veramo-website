## IssuerType type

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

The issuer of a [VerifiableCredential](./core-types.verifiablecredential.md) or the holder of a [VerifiablePresentation](./core-types.verifiablepresentation.md).

The value of the issuer property MUST be either a URI or an object containing an id property. It is RECOMMENDED that the URI in the issuer or its id be one which, if de-referenced, results in a document containing machine-readable information about the issuer that can be used to verify the information expressed in the credential.

See [Issuer data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer)

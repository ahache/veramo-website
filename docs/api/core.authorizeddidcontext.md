## AuthorizedDIDContext interface

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

This context can be used for Veramo Agents that are created behind an authorization mechanism, that attaches a DID as the authorized executor of certain actions. This authorized DID is used to further filter the data that is available for querying.

This does not constitute an authorization mechanism, but relies on an authorization mechanism existing before the Veramo Agent is created.

This API may change without a BREAKING CHANGE notice.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript

Serto is in public beta. There will be some breaking changes in the coming months and we endeavour to communicate these in advance via our blog. However, we expect the core APIs to remain relatively stable. You can keep up to date here and get involved in our growing community. We are excited to see what you build with Serto!

:::

Serto is a framework that makes it easy for anyone to use cryptographically verifiable data in their applications.

These docs are written for anyone wishing to learn more about the grounding principles behind verifiable data and develop a deeper understanding of the Serto framework in order to build next generation apps that leverage the many benefits of [trust networks](/docs/).

Looking for ideas? You can [check out how you can easily build](/docs/) systems like uport, brightid, a custodial identity platform, a covid vaccine verification app and many more.

## How to use these docs

If you are new to the concept of verifiable data it would be best to read the fundamentals section linearly as each section builds on knowledge and terminology gained in the previous.

If you are more experienced with verifiable data concepts and or development in general you can dive into the architecture section where more specifics of how the internals work are covered or you could [deploy your own cloud agent](/docs/agent/cloud_agent). You can also jump over to the API reference section. Links and more info about these packages can also be found in the plugins section.

## Prerequisites

You need to have fundamental knowledge of JavaScript or some other programming language.

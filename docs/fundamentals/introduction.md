Veramo is in public beta. There will be some breaking changes in the coming months and we endeavour to communicate these in advance via our blog. However, we expect the core APIs to remain relatively stable. You can keep up to date here and get involved in our growing community. We are excited to see what you build with Veramo!

:::

Veramo is a framework that makes it easy for anyone to use cryptographically verifiable data in their applications.

These docs are written for anyone wishing to learn more about the grounding principles behind verifiable data and develop a deeper understanding of the Veramo framework in order to build next generation apps that leverage the many benefits of [trust networks](/docs/).

Looking for ideas? You can [check out how you can easily build](/docs/) systems like uport, brightid, a custodial identity platform, a covid vaccine verification app and many more.

## How to use these docs

If you are new to the concept of verifiable data it would be best to read the fundamentals section linearly as each section builds on knowledge and terminology gained in the previous.

If you are more experienced with verifiable data concepts and or development in general you can dive into the architecture section where more specifics of how the internals work are covered or you could [deploy your own cloud agent](/docs/agent/cloud_agent). You can also jump over to the API reference section. Links and more info about these packages can also be found in the plugins section.

## Prerequisites

You need to have fundamental knowledge of JavaScript or some other programming language.

## How we got here

The core team spent years working on products that used verifiable data and found that there were so many dependencies and moving parts that it was near impossible to manage across multiple platforms (mobile, web & server) and still have time to focus on the product.

Our objective was to create a framework that would abstract all of the underlying complexity that exists in applications that use digital data verification. Originally the team were focused on products in the identity space but when the core components were abstracted away it became clear that identity was just one of many product types that could be built using Veramo.

For these reasons we say that Veramo is not specifically an SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) framework; it provides the foundation and tools to build SSI and many other data verification related products.
